This repository contains my solution to the assignment based on the board game Modern Art. The project implements a simplified version of the game in Java, allowing for three players to participate in fixed auctions for various art pieces.
Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I practiced:

    Basic object-oriented programming principles
    Utilizing ArrayList for dynamic collections
    Implementing game logic and design patterns

The assignment took approximately eight hours to complete, emphasizing the importance of starting early and seeking help when needed.

The project consists of the following Java files:

    ModernArt.java: The main game logic and interface.
    Player.java: The player class, handling player actions and attributes.
